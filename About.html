    <h3>Background </h3>
    <br>
        <p>   In April 2007, Essel Group launched the Indian Cricket League (ICL), in partnership with IL&FS.[21][22] The ICL
        was not recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council
        (ICC). Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[23][24] In
        response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players
        who joined the ICL, which it considered a rebel league.[25][26]</p>

      <h3> Foundation</h3> 
       <p> On 13 September 2007, as the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 began, the BCCI launched the Indian Premier League, an
        annual franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition.[27] The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April
        2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL
        initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and
        squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-man governing council, would also serve as the
        qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.[27][28]

        To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008. The reserve prices for
        the eight franchises totalled $400 million,[26] but the auction ultimately raised $723.59 million.[29] The
        league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi
        Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders
        (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).[30]

        In 2009, the BCCI and other national boards offered amnesty to rival ICL's players and officials, provided they
        terminated their contracts. The resulting player exodus and financial difficulties forced ICL to shut down later
        that year.[31][32][33]


        A match during the 2008 IPL inaugural season in Chennai
        Expansions and terminations
        New franchises, Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala, joined the league before the fourth season in
        2011.[34] The Sahara Adventure Sports Group purchased the Pune franchise for $370 million, while Rendezvous
        Sports World bought the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million.[34] The Kochi franchise was terminated after just
        one season due to their failure to pay the BCCI the 10% bank guarantee element of the franchise fee.[35]

        In September 2012, the Deccan Chargers franchise agreement was terminated after the BCCI failed to find new
        owners.[36] In October, an auction was held for a replacement franchise; Sun TV Network won the bid for what
        became the Hyderabad franchise;[37] the team was named Sunrisers Hyderabad.[38]

        Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL in May 2013 due to financial differences with the BCCI.[39] The BCCI
        officially terminated the franchise in October, and the league reverted to eight teams.[40]

        In June 2015, the two-time champions Chennai Super Kings and the inaugural season champions Rajasthan Royals
        were suspended for two seasons following their involvement in a spot-fixing and betting scandal.[41] The two
        teams were replaced for two seasons by franchises based in Pune and Rajkot.[42][43]

        Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue for the 2020 season was moved and games were played in the United Arab
        Emirates.[44][45] In August 2021, the BCCI announced that two new franchises, based in two of six shortlisted
        cities, would join the league in the 2022 season.[46][47] In closed bidding held in October, the RPSG Group and
        CVC Capital won the bids for the teams, paying ₹7,000 crore (US$820 million) and ₹5,200 crore (US$610 million),
        respectively.[48][49] The teams were subsequently named Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans.

        Several IPL franchise owners have expanded their business by acquiring teams in other franchise leagues, such as
        the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), South Africa's SA20, the UAE's International League T20 (ILT) and the USA's
        Major League Cricket (MLC).

        In addition to these acquisitions, Delhi Capitals also bought a stake in MLC's Seattle Orcas.[50]

        In 2025, stakes in teams from The Hundred became available. RPSG Group (owners of the Super Giants) bought a 70%
        stake in Manchester Originals for around £81m, while Mumbai Indians bought at 49% stake in the Oval Invincibles
        for £60m.[51] Yorkshire sold 100% of Northern Superchargers to Sun Group (Sunrisers Hyderabad) for £100m.[52]
        The GMR Group (Delhi Capitals) had already acquired Hampshire in a 2024 deal, including the club's 51% stake in
        the Southern Brave[53] and bought the remaining 49% for around £48m.[54]</p>
